## MIT License (Effective January 1, 2027) with Early Access

> **tl;dr** (plain English, non-legal summary):
> - This is NOT a Fair Source License or similar restrictive license
> - Full MIT License takes effect January 1, 2027 - irrevocably and unconditionally
> - Until then, it's like MIT for everyone except three specific product categories
> - These restrictions are permanent and cannot be expanded - protecting both you and us
> - We tried to maximize and make extremely clear the "safe harbor" definition
>
> If you're not building a direct here.build competitor in the three specific categories below,
> this license doesn't restrict you at all. If you're unsure or have an edge case,
> contact team@here.build - we want to enable your use case if it doesn't directly compete.

**Irrevocability**: The MIT License grant effective January 1, 2027 is irrevocable
and unconditional. No future version of this license can restrict rights granted here.

## Early Access Grant (Until January 1, 2027)

> **tl;dr** (plain English, non-legal summary):
> - You can use this NOW under MIT terms, except for three specific uses
> - Restrictions apply to PRODUCTS not COMPANIES (e.g. Google can use this internally or for other products even if competing)
> - Only affects commercial, public-facing services - not internal tools or open source

Additionally, permission is hereby granted, effective immediately, to use this
software under the same MIT terms above, EXCEPT when deploying this software as
or within:

### Excluded Commercial Services:

1. **Visual Development Platforms**: Commercial services marketed as no-code, low-code,
   or visual development tools where end users build applications through visual or
   natural language interfaces

2. **MCP Infrastructure Services**: Commercial intermediary services for Model Context
   Protocol that provide aggregation, routing, analytics, or optimization between
   MCP clients and servers
    - *Explicitly permitted*: Direct MCP client implementations

3. **CRDT Collaboration Infrastructure**: Commercial services providing CRDT-based
   synchronization, collaboration, or presence infrastructure as a service to
   third-party applications

### Always Permitted (even for excluded categories):

- **Internal use** - Any internal tools, regardless of your business
- **Open source** - Open source distributions (under same terms of this license)
- **Other products** - Any products outside the three categories above
- **Development** - Evaluation, testing, and development (non-production)

### Clarifications:

- "Commercial service" means offered to the public for payment (including freemium)
- This restricts DEPLOYMENT not DISTRIBUTION - you can fork and share freely under terms of this license
- If you're unsure if your use case is excluded, it probably isn't

### Why This License Structure?

> you can omit this section when copying the license terms

The technology set released by here.build represents 2 years of research and development.
We believe these discoveries are too important to withhold from the community until
we achieve commercial success, yet we acknowledge they could be used to compete directly against us.

Traditional restrictive licenses - even well-intentioned ones like FSL - create
real problems for developers trying to build with the technology. Their vague
"competing use" definitions create uncertainty and can change over time.

Instead, we chose a structure that reflects our actual intent:
- Full MIT for everyone starting January 1, 2027 - no strings attached
- Early access today for everyone except three specific, narrowly-defined competitors

We've personally experienced the friction that "balancing" licenses create, so we
intentionally designed this to be usable for 99% of products. The specific category
exclusions solve FSL's problem of vague and shifting definitions. The ~1 year timeframe
(instead of the typical 2 years) reflects our confidence - we need enough runway to
establish here.build, but not so much that we block potential pivots or partnerships.

This gives everyone certainty: you know exactly what you're getting and when.
