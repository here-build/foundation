/**
 * The runtime half of `(declare/expose …)` — the "sealed skill" form.
 *
 * Where `extractExpose` reads a declaration's SIGNATURE statically (parse only,
 * handler never runs — the config-plane sync path), this is what happens when a
 * program actually EVALUATES the form: it captures the input/output schemas and
 * the handler closure, hands a typed `ExposeDeclaration` to the host (host's
 * registry), and returns the handler so the same function is callable in-program.
 *
 * `(declare/expose "classify-ticket"
 *    :input  (s/object (s/field/string "message"))
 *    :output (s/object (s/field/string "label") (s/field/number "confidence"))
 *    :handler (lambda (input) …))`
 *
 * The schema args evaluate (via the `s/…` preamble rosettas already on the env)
 * to canonical tagged lists — the SAME shape `extractExpose` slices as source
 * and the SAME shape the picoschema/`schema→zod` lowering consumes — so the
 * static and runtime views can never describe different contracts.
 *
 * The handler crosses the rosetta membrane as a plain async callable (a scheme
 * `(lambda …)` is a JS function on the far side). We wrap it so the host calls
 * `decl.handler(jsInput)` and gets a plain JS value back (the wrapper applies
 * the LIPS→JS membrane on the result) — the host layers zod validation on top;
 * keys/credentials are never in scope here (this module touches neither).
 *
 * Injection mirrors `infer: InferFn`: `buildArrivalEnv` takes an optional
 * `onExpose` sink. When the host omits it, the form still evaluates and returns
 * the handler (usable in-program) — it just isn't registered anywhere. Same
 * "capability is optional, the verb always exists" posture as `import`/`require`.
