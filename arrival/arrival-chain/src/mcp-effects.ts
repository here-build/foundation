/**
 * Host capability interface for MCP — the membrane through which a run's MCP tool
 * calls reach the outside world. The CLIENT-side twin of {@link ./data-effects}: the
 * OSS engine knows the VERBS, never the CREDENTIALS.
 *
 * A program/agent names a server by LABEL (intent); the resolver maps that label to a
 * decrypted, credentialed MCP client transport HOST-SIDE — the same membrane the LLM
 * keys cross (the interface vends BEHAVIOUR, not the secret). Scheme holds only the
 * server NAME and override λs; the only path to the real server is `next`, which runs
 * host-side, so credentials can never materialise in the sandbox.
 *
 * INERT BY DEFAULT. Like infer/data, the MCP capability REJECTS at call time until a
 * {@link McpEffectResolver} is injected via `buildArrivalEnv({ mcp })`. The OSS engine
 * ships MCP disarmed: a program that mentions an MCP server analyses fine, but invoking
 * one throws a teaching error ({@link inertMcpResolver}) — never a silent no-op, never a
 * network call. The credentialed resolver (roster lookup, envelope-decrypt, SDK `Client`
 * transport) is host-private, NOT part of this package.
 *
 * SERVER-TAPE replay. MCP calls are recorded POSITIONALLY per (inference, server) — not
 * by content like infer/http/sql — because an MCP call's result depends on the server's
 * hidden mutable state (read-after-write). {@link wrapMcpResolver} implements record/replay
 * over that tape: replay is HERMETIC (returns the recorded reply, NEVER re-fires — so a
 * what-if cannot trigger a second destructive action) and VERIFIES the recorded
 * `{server,method,request}` against the live call, stopping on divergence rather than
 * silently serving a stale value.
