## Future MIT License (Irrevocable, Effective Starting January 1, 2027)

On and after January 1, 2027, this software is MIT licensed, irrevocably:

Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy
of this software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to deal
in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights
to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell
copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is

AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER

**This grant is irrevocable.** No future version of this license can restrict
rights granted here.

## Current License (Until December 31, 2026)

Until the MIT license takes effect, you may use this software under MIT terms
**EXCEPT** for these three commercial uses:

### Excluded Commercial Uses:

1. **No-code/low-code/visual development platforms** - Commercial services where
   users build applications primarily through visual or natural language interfaces

2. **MCP infrastructure services** - Commercial intermediary services between MCP
   clients and servers, both observing and transforming
   - *Explicitly permitted*: Direct MCP client and server implementations

3. **CRDT collaboration infrastructure** - Commercial services providing CRDT-based
   synchronization, collaboration, or presence infrastructure as a service to
   third-party applications

**"Commercial" means**: Offered to external users for payment or other consideration
(including freemium, enterprise licenses, or subscription models).

### Always Permitted:

- **Internal company use** - Any internal tools, regardless of your business
- **Open source redistribution** - Under the terms of this license
- **Products outside the three categories** - Any other products or services
- **Development and testing** - Evaluation, research, and non-production use

### Derivative Works:

This license applies to the software, derivative works, modifications, and
substantial portions thereof. Redistribution must include this license.

## Contributions

By contributing to this project (via pull request, issue, or other means), you
agree that your contributions will be licensed under the same terms as this
license. You retain copyright to your contributions.

## Why This Structure?

We need approximately one year to establish here.build before unrestricted
competition. After January 1, 2027, everyone gets full MIT rights - no strings
attached, no rolling windows.

The three exclusions are narrow and specific. If you're building something and
unsure whether it's excluded, contact team@here.build for clarification or
potential exemptions.

## Upstream Licenses

**arrival-scheme** is a fork of [LIPS.js](https://github.com/jcubic/lips) (MIT licensed by Jakub T. Jankiewicz). We maintain the MIT license and comply with its terms. LIPS.js copyright notices are preserved in source files.
